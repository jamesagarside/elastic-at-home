# Traefik Static Configuration - Self-Signed Mode
#
# This configuration uses Elasticsearch-generated certificates via Traefik.
# No ACME/Let's Encrypt - works in air-gapped environments.
#
# Usage: Copy this file to traefik.yml (or symlink it)
#   cp traefik-selfsigned.yml traefik.yml
#
# Clients will need to trust the CA certificate from:
#   docker cp $(docker compose ps -q setup):/certs/ca/ca.crt ./ca.crt
