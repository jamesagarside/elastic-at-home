# Traefik Configuration - Self-Signed Mode
#
# This configuration uses ES CA-signed certificates for all services.
# All domain names are included as SANs in a single certificate.
#
# Browser Access:
#   Click "proceed to site" when prompted about the untrusted certificate.
#   Use incognito/private browsing if you encounter cached certificate issues.
#
# Agent Enrollment:
#   Agents connecting to Fleet/ES should trust the CA certificate:
#   docker cp $(docker compose ps -q setup):/certs/ca/ca.crt ./ca.crt
#
# No ACME/Let's Encrypt - works in air-gapped environments.
