# Traefik Static Configuration - Let's Encrypt Mode
#
# This configuration uses Let's Encrypt with Cloudflare DNS challenge
# for publicly trusted TLS certificates.
#
# Prerequisites (all set in .env file):
# 1. INGRESS_MODE=letsencrypt
# 2. ACME_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
# 3. CF_DNS_API_TOKEN=your-cloudflare-api-token
#
# This file is auto-selected when INGRESS_MODE=letsencrypt

# Let's Encrypt ACME Configuration
# Email is set via ACME_EMAIL env var in .env file
#
# Note: If ACME fails with SERVFAIL errors, Traefik will automatically retry
# with exponential backoff. The default certificate from traefik-dynamic.yaml
# is served while retrying. Common causes of SERVFAIL:
# - Transient DNS issues (usually resolves on retry)
# - Zone not properly delegated to Cloudflare
# - CF_DNS_API_TOKEN lacking Zone:Zone:Read permission
